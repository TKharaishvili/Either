# Either.Analyzers

Discriminated unions/Union types with native C# switch statement/expression exhaustiveness support.

This package contains analyzers and code fixes only that enforce exhaustive usage of `Either<T1, T2...>` types with switch statements/expressions and more. To get the full experience(types as well as code analysis) install the [Either.Main](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Either.Main) package.

For more information, have a look at the [Github readme](https://github.com/kharai-tor/Either?tab=readme-ov-file#either).
